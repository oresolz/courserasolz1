               You have probably never heard of the phrase "Garri no dey get advert" The person that said that didnt lie, Garri has had a chokehold on Nigerian households since we became independent, I'm sure even before we became independent and not once has there been a single advertisement on television to promote Garri. I havent even told you what Garri is yet, its just cassava that learnt javascript.
